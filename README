Thanks for you interest in our modules! There's still a lot missing here, like
documentation, but having it published will force us a bit to take note of it
and actually start on those parts as well.

Please keep in mind that we do not automatically update our repository on each
change on our side, to give us some time in case of stupid mistakes (think
passwords) to fix it. We do try to update regularly however.

If you have any questions or additions, feel free to send pull requests or
create issues for this.
