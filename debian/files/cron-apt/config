# Configuration for cron-apt.
# The cron config is located in /etc/cron.d/cron-apt
# This shows the defaults.

# The command used to execute all actions.  By default, apt-get is used.
# Change this to /usr/bin/aptitude to use aptitude instead, which will
# resolve changed Recommends (and Suggests as well, if aptitude is so
# configured). You can also set other utilities (especially useful in the
# config.d directory) so set some completely different tool.
# OBSERVE that this tool is indended for apt-get and tools like aptitude do not
# have full support for noninteractive upgrades. You may have to tune options
# to not create infinit logfiles for example.
# APTCOMMAND=/usr/bin/apt-get
# APTCOMMAND=/usr/bin/aptitude
# APTCOMMAND=/usr/bin/apt-file

# If FILTERCTRLM is "true", then any line containing ^M in the apt-get
# output will be filtered from log/mail/console output.  This is useful
# with aptitude, which does not currently support -qq (very quiet).
# This feature is considered exprimental and will not work with
# for example MAILON=upgrade.
# FILTERCTRLM="false"

# A path is needed for this to work. This is the default PATH.

# If you want to allow unauthenticated and untrusted packages add the
# following to your options directive.
# This will only work with aptitude >= 0.3.5
# The --assume-yes option will answer yes to almost all questions. This
# is not very safe, and can fill up your /tmp file system (#316606) due
# to an aptitude bug (#332885) which shows if --assume-yes is used and
