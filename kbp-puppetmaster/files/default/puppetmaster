# What server type to run 
# Options: 
# 	   webrick (default, cannot handle more than ~30 nodes)
#	   mongrel (scales better than webrick because you can run
#	    	    multiple processes if you are getting
#	    	    connection-reset or End-of-file errors, switch to
#	    	    mongrel. Requires front-end web-proxy such as
#	    	    apache, nginx, or pound)
#	   See: http://reductivelabs.com/trac/puppet/wiki/UsingMongrel
SERVERTYPE=mongrel

# How many puppetmaster instances to start? Its pointless to set this
# higher than 1 if you are not using mongrel. 
PUPPETMASTERS=2

# What port should the puppetmaster listen on (default: 18140). If 
# PUPPETMASTERS is set to a number greater than 1, then the port
# for the first puppetmaster will be set to the below port, and further
# instances will be incremented by one

PORT=18140
