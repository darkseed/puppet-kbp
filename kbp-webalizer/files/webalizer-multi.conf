# Directory where webalizer should write its reports to.
OUTPUT_DIR=/var/www/webalizer

# Generate webalizer reports for every site for which a subdirectory exists in
# SITE_BASE_DIR.  Set SITE_BASE_DIR to the same value as OUTPUT_DIR if you want
# to be able to control for which sites reports will be generated.  If you want
# reports to be added automatically for any new websites, set it to the root
# dir of your websites, e.g. /var/www.
#SITES_BASE_DIR=/var/www/webalizer
SITES_BASE_DIR=/var/www

# If LOGS is set to a directory, reports will be generated from log files with
# the name $LOG/$sitename-access.log, where $sitename is the name of the site's
# subdirectory inside $SITE_BASE_DIR.
#
# If LOGS is set to a filename, reports for all sites will be generated from
# the same log file.  The log entries in the log file need to have the
# servername for the request as their last field.  This allows the script to
# know which site the log entry belongs to.  For Apache you can do this by
# adding %V to your log format:
#
#   LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\" %T/%D %V" vhostcombined
#   CustomLog /var/log/apache2/access.log vhostcombined
#
#LOGS=/var/log/apache2/access.log
LOGS=/var/log/apache2
